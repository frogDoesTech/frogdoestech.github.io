If you scroll down to the bottom of this post, you will see a "clap" button.

If you hit that button, a little animation should pop up, and the number of claps next to the button will increment.

If you refresh the page, the number will stay there, meaning - this is the real thing! Not one of those fake like buttons you still see on some static sites!

I added this with [Lyket](https://lyket.dev/).

Lyket seems good enough for "serious" content creators, but is small and simple enough for little frogs like me. It has a dashboard to check how many likes you got on what page or post. Also you can disable session tracking (which I did), and just let people anonymously mash 👏 these 👏 buttons 👏

It comes with a free plan to try out the service, which they say you "have to" upgrade to paid if you exceed 500 page views within a month. I'll see how that works out, I understand it will just freeze the use of the buttons until the end of the month.

Setup is mega simple, you add the Lyket script (of course with bare-ass API key) to your page, and then another script with the button wherever you want it. You can have a separate button for each page/ post (differentiated by unique ID), or just have a bunch of buttons around your site all with the same ID, and just let people add their likes to one big pile of likes? I think that's cool too.

That's the end of the post, you can now mash the button some more if you want.
